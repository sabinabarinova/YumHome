There is a high significance of cooking that is well-known in modern life. Specifically, home cooking is one of the approaches to a healthy lifestyle since it impacts improved diet quality and contributes to the recognition of healthy food. However, people are increasingly relying on food prepared away from home due to the fast-paced nature of today’s world and the convenience of food delivery technologies, which has led to cooking taking a back seat. Additionally, the lack of a competitive cooking app offering features similar to those of Western mobile applications is another reason why people do not prefer to cook at home, resulting in a significant gap in the IT field of CIS countries.
In response to these challenges, this diploma project aims to provide users with a valuable tool for their culinary pursuits, inspiring people and satisfying both social and technological requirements. The app is designed with contemporary design solutions, offering a wide range of necessary features and convenient in-app navigation. By simplifying recipe discovery and fostering a sense of community around cooking, the app aims to encourage users to explore their potential food preferences and dietary restrictions, enhancing their personal experience in cooking.
Extensive research has been conducted to inform the development of the app. A mixed methodology approach was employed, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the vision and opinions of both proficient cooks and cooking enthusiasts. The proficient cooks were interviewed, providing valuable insights through open-ended questions, while the cooking enthusiasts participated in a survey featuring close-ended and multiple-choice questions. Additionally, a thorough market analysis was conducted, comparing the main Western cooking applications to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
The culmination of this research and analysis has guided the definition of the app’s features and design. The app boasts an aesthetic and modern UI design, ensuring an engaging and visually appealing user experience. The seamless in-app navigation further enhances user convenience, allowing for effortless exploration and utilization of the app’s functionalities.
Overall, this diploma project aims to bridge the gap in the CIS countries’ cooking app market by offering a comprehensive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing solution that inspires users to embrace home cooking and explore new culinary horizons.
